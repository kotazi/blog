##### ◯ Practice 3 | Studying the Manual

- Correct timing. It is best to apologize as fast as you can, but no need to be impulsive. You needto prepare what to say.
- Wisely chosen means of communication. There are many ways to apologize: you can apologizein person, over the phone or write an apology letter. Having eye contact is a good thing since apologies are personal; however, if a person was deeply hurt, a letter might be a better way.
- Explanation without excuses. After apologizing you can shortly explain why this happened, but be careful not to start making excuses. This would be impolite.
- “The customer is always right” principle. Whenever you need to apologize to the customer or business partner, you need to think about this principle. Most of the time it is better to accept all the blame.
- A quick explanation of what you will do not to let this happen again.
